# Smart-Inventory-Tracking-with-Barcode-Scanning
Smart Inventory Tracking with Barcode Scanning

📌 Project Overview

Manual inventory tracking is slow, error-prone, and inefficient for small warehouses.
This project provides an affordable alternative by using:
	•	Python
	•	Barcode generation
	•	Real-time detection (images + video)
	•	Automatic inventory updates
	•	Excel-based reporting

The system is ideal for small electronics warehouses, retail shops, and logistics startups.
